# Build ingredients

Everything baked into the shipped `.pkg`s (both variants), where it is pinned, and how a change to it
reaches a release. An *ingredient* is an input to the product; the *own upstream* is the thing this repo exists
to port. An own-upstream bump cuts `<upstream>-mavericks.1`; an ingredient bump cuts a
`-mavericks.(N+1)` repackage of the same upstream, via
`.github/workflows/repackage-on-ingredient-bump.yml`.

| Ingredient | Pinned in | Renovate | On a bump |
|---|---|---|---|
| LLVM/Clang source (own upstream) | `UPSTREAM_VERSION` (repo root) | ✅ customManager → `github-tags` on `llvm/llvm-project`, capped to this repo's line | `release.yml` on push to main cuts `-mavericks.1` |
| Recaulk (prebuilt librecaulk.a + headers) | `components/recaulk/version` | ✅ shipyard preset manager → github-releases on Mavergreen/recaulk | watched path → repackage dispatched |
| LLVM release-signing keys | `keys/llvm-release.asc` | ❌ **untrackable — manual refresh** (see below) | not a watched path; a stale bundle fails the build loudly, never silently |
| MacOSX10.9 SDK | `Mavergreen/shipyard@v1` (`fetch_sdk.sh`) | ✅ github-actions manager tracks the tag | `@v1` is a *moving* tag, so content moves without any path here changing |
| Sparkle framework (embedded in the updater `.app`) | `Mavergreen/shipyard@v1` (`mavericks_fetch_sparkle`; Sparkle 1.x — the last line that runs on 10.9) | ✅ via `@v1` (github-actions manager) | content moves with `@v1` |
| Sparkle EdDSA public key | `updater/ed25519_key.pub` | ❌ untrackable (our own key) | baked into the updater's `Info.plist` as `SUPublicEDKey`; paired with the `SPARKLE_PRIVATE_KEY` secret |

Not ingredients: `build/*.sh` and `native-bootstrap/` are this repo's own recipe — a change there is a
repackage you cut deliberately (`workflow_dispatch` with `local_release=true`), not something Renovate
drives.

Shipped shim (`build/shim/` → `include/mavericks-compat/` in the toolchain): hand-authored back-fill
header `pthread/qos.h`, which adds the `qos_class_self`/`qos_class_main` that Recaulk's own
`pthread/qos.h` does not declare (LLVM's `Threading.inc` includes it; so may user code). Its sibling
`build/shim/aligned_alloc.h` is force-included into the runtimes build only and is not shipped. The
shim is our own source, not an external input, so
there is nothing for Renovate to pin or track — but unlike `build/*.sh` it is **baked into the
artifact** (`clang.cfg` references it via `-isystem`), so it is recorded here for anyone auditing what
the shipped toolchain contains. A change to it is a deliberate repackage, like a patch.

## Why no source checksum is pinned for LLVM

There is no `LLVM_SHA256` in `build/versions.sh` on purpose. A pinned hash cannot vouch for a tarball
that does not exist yet, so it is exactly the thing that blocks the bot: every LLVM bump would need a
human to fetch and paste one. Instead `build/build-cross.sh` GPG-verifies
`llvm-project-<ver>.src.tar.xz` against `keys/llvm-release.asc` — a signature vouches for bytes nobody
has seen, which is what makes a Renovate bump of `UPSTREAM_VERSION` self-contained.

## Why the LLVM signing keys are untracked

`keys/llvm-release.asc` is LLVM's published release-key bundle, fetched verbatim from
<https://releases.llvm.org/release-keys.asc> — the URL llvm/llvm-project's own release body names
under "Verifying Packages". There is no version or datasource for Renovate to compare against, so
there is nothing to track.

It carries **all six** LLVM release managers rather than only whoever signed the currently pinned
release. LLVM rotates who cuts a release (22.1.1 was Douglas Yung), so a single-key bundle would make
a routine Renovate bump fail on an unrelated-looking GPG error the day the rotation lands — defeating
the point of preferring a signature to a hash. Carrying the set LLVM publishes for this purpose is
their own trust model, not a widening of ours. Refresh the file if LLVM adds a release manager; the
failure mode is a loud build failure at `gpg --verify`, never a silent downgrade.

## Lines, and the two variants a line ships

A **line** is an LLVM major (this repo's root `UPSTREAM_VERSION` = 22.1.1, LINE 22). One repo ships
one LLVM major: a clang-22 user is never carried onto clang-23, because LLVM 23 arrives as a new
repo, not a bump of this one's `UPSTREAM_VERSION`. The Renovate manager uses a `depName`
(`llvm-22`) with `packageName` pointing at the real repo, capped to this line -- an uncapped line
is one Renovate bump away from silently becoming a different product.

Each line ships **two toolchain variants from one release**, plus the libcxx22 runtime. The two
variants are members of the `clang` group, so one box can hold both, and `mavergreen select clang`
picks which one owns the bare names:

| Variant | Runs on | Prefix | Identifier | Install floor |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| native | x86_64 Mavericks (the flagship) | `/usr/local/mavergreen/clang<line>` | `dev.mavergreen.clang.clang<line>` | **10.9.5** |
| cross | modern arm64 macOS | `/usr/local/mavergreen/clang<line>-cross` | `dev.mavergreen.clang.clang<line>-cross` | 11.0 |
| libcxx22 (runtime) | x86_64 Mavericks | `/usr/local/mavergreen/libcxx<line>` | `dev.mavergreen.clang.libcxx<line>` | 10.9.5 |

libcxx22 is relinked from the cross build's `libc++.a`/`libc++abi.a` by `build/build-libcxx.sh`; its group
is `libcxx`, and its build-info agrees with the toolchains on `llvm`, `recaulk` and `target`.

Both target `x86_64-apple-macos10.9`, and both are built on the modern arm64 runner in one run — the
native variant is cross-*hosted* using the cross variant as its compiler, so nothing x86_64 is ever
executed during the build. Their `build-info-*.txt` records must agree on `llvm` and `recaulk`
(conformance compares any key appearing in more than one variant); `variant`, `arch`, `prefix`, `pkg`
and `identifier` are the keys that are supposed to differ.

## Conformance deviations

- rosetta:tests/smoke-native.sh: the native-toolchain smoke test primes Rosetta (`softwareupdate --install-rosetta`) and runs the staged x86_64/10.9 `clang++` under `arch -x86_64` to compile and execute a hello-world, proving the shipped native toolchain actually works rather than just looking right on disk. This is the check the cross variant cannot run (its host tools are arm64 by design); only the native leg's shipped x86_64 host clang++ needs it. Availability never gates: it SKIPs when `arch -x86_64 clang++ --version` cannot execute at all (no Rosetta), but once Rosetta demonstrably runs the binary, a compile/link/run failure is treated as a real product defect, not skipped. Reconsider when this validation can run on an x86_64 host (the 10.9 box or an Intel runner) instead of via Rosetta on the arm64 release runner; at the latest before macOS 28 removes Rosetta.
- rosetta:tests/libcxx-runtime-test.sh: runs an x86_64/10.9 C++ program against the staged libcxx22 on the arm64 release runner, proving exceptions, iostreams and threads work through the dylibs; it primes Rosetta (`softwareupdate --install-rosetta`) first on a non-x86_64 host. In CI an inability to run x86_64 fails the step (the workflow does not treat its exit 77 as a skip), because this is the only CI proof that an exception thrown in one image is caught in another and that libcxx22 coexists with the system libc++; run locally, the test SKIPs instead. Reconsider when it can run on the 10.9 box or an Intel runner in CI; at the latest before macOS 28 removes Rosetta.
Machine-read by `artifact-facts.sh` as `- <check>:<glob> : <reason>` (one line each, plain glob):

- shipyard-cmake-only:native-bootstrap/*: this tree bootstraps a whole toolchain from nothing on a
  stock 10.9 box, so it cannot presuppose an installed shipyard, and its `cmake` is deliberately not
  whichever one is on `PATH`. `build_tools()` builds cmake 3.19.8 into `toolchains/tools/bin` (the
  newest the 10.9 libc++ can compile — 3.21+ fails) and prepends that to `PATH`; stages A–C then
  configure LLVM 3.9.1/6.0.1/14.0.6 with exactly it, and stage D switches to the `cmake-new` it
  builds later, named through `$CMAKE`. Writing `shipyard-cmake` in stages A–C would substitute a
  different cmake for the one the stage was pinned to and require the pkg on a box that by
  construction has nothing installed. None of these configures a shipyard consumer — no
  `find_package(MavericksShipyard)` is involved — so the runtime refusal never fires here either.
  Revisit if native-bootstrap ever builds this repo's own CMakeLists.txt, or if the shipyard pkg
  becomes a bootstrap prerequisite.
- floor:mavericks-clang-*-cross-*.pkg: the cross toolchain runs on macOS 11 and later (arm64) and only targets 10.9, so its archive's install floor is 11.0, not 10.9.5

## Deferred from family conventions (not artifact-conformance checks)

- **Generic (opt-in) updater icon** — the Sparkle updater ships the standard macOS app icon by
  explicit opt-in (`MAVERICKS_ALLOW_GENERIC_ICON=ON`), embedding no artwork at all, pending a real
  Mavericks-Clang mark. Not the LLVM dragon (trademark, and it would read as official LLVM). See
  `updater/ICON-CREDIT.txt`.
- **SDK not redistributed** — the Apple MacOSX10.9 SDK is not baked into the artifact. The pkg ships
  `libexec/fetch_sdk.sh` and fetches on first use (golang precedent + redistribution cleanliness).
