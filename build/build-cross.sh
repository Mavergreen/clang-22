# THE RUNTIMES TARGET IS NOT THE PRODUCT TARGET, and it cannot be. LLVM's runtimes/CMakeLists.txt
# check_apple_target() hard-rejects any platform-specific Apple triple in LLVM_RUNTIME_TARGETS --
# "x86_64-apple-macos10.9" fails with FATAL_ERROR and has no opt-out, because compiler-rt on Darwin
# builds every platform/arch from one configuration and so must be named by a bare darwin triple.
# (The check runs for every LLVM_RUNTIME_TARGETS entry, so dropping compiler-rt does not avoid it.)
# So the runtimes are built as x86_64-apple-darwin with RUNTIMES_BUILD_ALLOW_DARWIN, and 10.9 is
# imposed the way compiler-rt expects: deployment target + the pinned 10.9 sysroot + osx-only archs.
# $TARGET_TRIPLE stays the PRODUCT's default target (what clang.cfg selects); tests/smoke-target.sh
# is what proves the pairing actually yields a 10.9 binary.
RUNTIME_TARGET="x86_64-apple-darwin"
# Per-runtime-target flags use the RUNTIMES_<triple>_<var> prefix. -fno-jump-tables is
# belt-and-suspenders for old-linker relocation quirks.
#
# compiler-rt is BUILTINS ONLY, which takes eight explicit OFFs rather than the four obvious ones.
# Everything else in compiler-rt pulls in sanitizer_common, which needs os/log.h (10.12+) that neither
# the 10.9 SDK nor Recaulk has -- Recaulk carries os/lock.h, not os/log.h. Turning
# off SANITIZERS alone leaves CTX_PROFILE and GWP_ASAN at their default ON, and the build still dies
# in sanitizer_mac.cpp with a missing header that looks nothing like "you forgot a switch".
#
# HOST-LIBRARY HYGIENE -- three settings, all load-bearing for a SHIPPED toolchain. LLVM opportunis-
# tically links whatever optional libraries the BUILD HOST happens to have, bakes the absolute path
# into every binary's load commands, and the result installs fine and dies at first launch on a user's
# machine. Measured, not theorised: before these, verify-relocatable.sh found 94 of 97 staged Mach-O
# depending on /opt/pkg/lib/libz.1.dylib and /opt/pkg/lib/libedit.0.dylib.
#
#   ZSTD=OFF                 -- no libzstd on a stock macOS at all, so there is nothing to link but a
#                               package manager's copy.
#   CMAKE_IGNORE_PREFIX_PATH -- keeps find_package/find_library out of every package-manager prefix
#                               (pkgsrc, Homebrew, MacPorts, Fink), so zlib resolves to the SDK's
#                               libz.tbd => a dependency on /usr/lib/libz.1.dylib, present everywhere.
#   LIBEDIT=OFF              -- LLVM's FindLibEdit goes through pkg-config, which ignores
#                               CMAKE_IGNORE_PREFIX_PATH entirely, so the prefix guard cannot reach
#                               it. The shipped product is a compiler and linker; libedit only serves
#                               interactive line editing (clang-repl/clang-query), so dropping it
#                               removes a host-dependent dependency rather than a feature we ship.
#
# ncurses is left alone: it resolves to /usr/lib on macOS and the audit confirms it. libxml2 is OFF
# for the same class of reason (llvm-mt is not part of this product).
#
# -isystem the directory that DIRECTLY CONTAINS the wrapper headers, not its parent. This is the
# whole mechanism: Recaulk ships shadow headers (time.h, stdlib.h, dirent.h, ...) that
# #include_next the SDK header and add the newer-than-10.9 declarations, so they only work when they
# shadow the real header name. Pointed at the parent (.../include) they are merely reachable as
# <recaulk/time.h>, which nothing includes -- and libc++ then fails to compile with
# "use of undeclared identifier 'CLOCK_REALTIME'" / 'CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW', because on Apple its
# steady_clock calls clock_gettime unconditionally. Same wiring native-bootstrap/build.sh proved.
#
# -include shim/aligned_alloc.h back-fills the ONE 10.9-missing symbol the shadow headers do not cover
# and libc++ cannot be told to stop using (see that header). Runtimes sub-build only -- never the
# shipped clang.cfg.
#
# THE HOST TOOLS RECORD THE ARM64 PIN. With no CMAKE_OSX_* the host compiler targets the runner's own
# macOS and SDK, and every clang/lld binary and host library in the cross pkg recorded minos 26.0 sdk
# 26.5. The three CMAKE_OSX_* settings below reach the host build and nothing else: LLVM configures
# the runtimes and builtins sub-builds through llvm_ExternalProject_Add, which forwards CMAKE_SYSROOT
# (unset here) but none of CMAKE_OSX_*, so those see only their own RUNTIMES_/BUILTINS_<triple>_
# values.
#
# THE BUILTINS ARE x86_64/10.9 ONLY, the one target this toolchain promises. Left alone, LLVM builds
# compiler-rt's builtins (lib/clang/<N>/lib/darwin/libclang_rt.*.a) in a separate "default" sub-build
# for the HOST triple, which receives none of the RUNTIMES_<triple>_ values -- the runtimes sub-build
# itself is configured with COMPILER_RT_BUILD_BUILTINS=OFF. That default build asked xcrun for an SDK
# and built every Apple platform and arch it could: i386, x86_64h, arm64, arm64e, the iOS and simulator
# libraries, and x86_64 at macOS 10.7 against the runner's SDK. LLVM_BUILTIN_TARGETS names the runtimes
# triple instead, so the builtins get their own sub-build that takes BUILTINS_<triple>_ values
# (RUNTIMES_BUILD_ALLOW_DARWIN admits the bare darwin triple there too):
#
#   DARWIN_macosx_CACHED_SYSROOT   -- the SDK compiler-rt passes as -isysroot to every builtins
#                                     compile; unset, it asks xcrun. CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT keeps the
#                                     sub-build's own configure checks on the same SDK.
#   DARWIN_osx_BUILTIN_ARCHS       -- a preset list is taken as already probed, so x86_64 is the only
#                                     macOS arch built.
#   COMPILER_RT_ENABLE_IOS         -- defaults ON whenever the runner has an iOS SDK.
#   COMPILER_RT_ENABLE_MACCATALYST -- defaults ON when the compiler accepts -darwin-target-variant,
#                                     and then compiles the macOS builtins for Mac Catalyst as well.
#
# The minimum is not a setting at all. compiler-rt clears CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET for the builtins
# and hardcodes DARWIN_osx_BUILTIN_MIN_VER 10.7, so step 2 rewrites that one line of the unpacked
# source (mav_pin_builtins_min_ver in build/lib.sh).

# -Wl,-U,__availability_version_check is a PRODUCT-level flag, not a build workaround. Any 10.9-targeted
# program using @available/__builtin_available pulls compiler-rt's os_version_check.c.o, which
# references that symbol. compiler-rt declares it __attribute__((weak_import)) and NULL-checks it
# before use, falling back to parsing /System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist -- precisely
# because it is absent before macOS 10.15. But weak_import only gets the linker off the hook when some
# library DECLARES the symbol, and the 10.9 SDK naturally does not, so ld64.lld fails the link outright:
#
#   ld64.lld: error: undefined symbol: _availability_version_check
#   >>> referenced by libclang_rt.osx.a(os_version_check.c.o)
#
# -U names that one symbol as legitimately-undefined, restoring the behaviour compiler-rt was written
# for. Scoped to a single symbol, and in the cfgs rather than this build alone so that USERS of either
# toolchain get it too -- LLVM's own sources hit this, and so will anyone else's.
#
# MIND THE UNDERSCORES: -U takes the MACH-O symbol, which carries the leading underscore C symbols
# get, so the C name `_availability_version_check` is `__availability_version_check` here. lld's
# diagnostic prints the C spelling, so copying the name out of the error message yields a -U that
# matches nothing and silently does not fix the link. `nm -m` on the archive member is what settles it.
#
# NOT -undefined dynamic_lookup, which also links but switches OFF undefined-symbol checking for the
# whole binary -- a real missing symbol would then ship and fail at launch. The reference is already
# `weak external` in the object (compiler-rt declares it __attribute__((weak_import))), so with -U it
# stays weak and dynamically-looked-up: 10.9's dyld binds it to NULL, compiler-rt's own NULL check
# fires, and the plist path runs. Verified on a built binary, not assumed.
#
# clang.cfg / clang++.cfg -- ported from native-bootstrap/build.sh wire_clang22, retargeted to

# zero per-project flags. Wired the NON-INVASIVE way: -isystem header shadows (which #include_next the
# SDK header and only take effect when code includes the normal header, so a bare -E or an .s file is
# untouched) plus a static archive resolved at link time. Deliberately NO -include force-header: that
