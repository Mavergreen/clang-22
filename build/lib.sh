# How many compile jobs an LLVM build may run at once.
#
# NOT just $(sysctl -n hw.ncpu). LLVM's heavier C++ translation units (DAGCombiner,
# LegalizeVectorTypes, the SelectionDAG family) peak well above 1GB of compiler memory each, so one
# job per core needs far more RAM than a core-count implies. On a 16GB box with swap disabled --
# `sysctl vm.swapusage` reporting total = 0.00M, which is not exotic on a tuned workstation -- the
# kernel simply SIGKILLs the compiler, and ninja reports the useless
#
#   build-native.sh: line NN: 27975 Killed: 9    ninja -C ... -j 8
#
# with no error above it to explain why. Measured here: -j8 died around 2000/4353 objects.
#
# So cap on BOTH cores and memory, at roughly 3GB per job. A CI runner with plenty of RAM is unaffected
# (its core count stays the binding constraint); a memory-tight machine slows down instead of failing.
# Override with MAVERICKS_JOBS when you know better than the heuristic.
# --- CI-only helpers (env-guarded; a plain local build sets neither var and is unaffected) -------
